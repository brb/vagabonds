_Yet another blog post which was long due. It was written during the trip
(but never published) , so some funny idealistic view inside._

It has been a while since me and Laura gave up cosy life and moved to a
campervan. This blog post gives an overview of our setup.

<!--break-->

Before getting into details, it's worth mentioning that our motivation for the
metamorphosis was to rehab from a city life by climbing rocks during a day
and poking keyboards offline during a night.

Anyway, to make it happen we thought about settling into a van which has:

- A bed for two
- Insulation and ventilation
- Electricity from green sources
- Cooking facilities
- Stealthy look

These would enable us to simply and comfortably live in nature near rocks and
mountains.

## Choosing a Van

Obviously, the first thing was to decide what kind of a van we would like to get.
We had the following options in mind:

- Buy a cargo van and convert by ourselves (requires time and some skills)
- Buy a camper van ($)
- Buy VW California ($$$)

Due to time constraints we opted for the second. We were lucky and found
the third generation Fiat Ducato X250 from 2008 with a relatively low mileage, some
DIY conversion and with a high top so that I can almost stand up.

After buying the van we had only one month to do any modifications, as we did not
want to skip summer climbing. We decided to skip any major changes to the existing layout,
insulation or furniture, and just do minor adjustments and some installations.

## Layout and Furniture

The existing layout gives enough space to function for two. In a single space
we have a bedroom, a kitchen, a dinning room, a storage room and even
an office space.

As we spend at least ~1/3rd of total trip time sleeping, a proper bed is super important to us.
At the back of the van we have a king size bed. Unfortunately, it is a bit
too short for me, so I have to sleep diagonally.

Under the bed we have a storage space for our climbing gear, skateboard, books and other things.
As we overestimated how much stuff we will bring with us (in the end it was a surprisingly
small amount), we decided to build a shelf above the bed which now accommodates our socks
(thanks to our parents for accommodating the rest of our stuff).

There are more shelves for storing food, dishes, clothes and shoes. See the picture below.
Each door of the shelf has neat clips which prevent the doors from opening when driving on shaky roads.

To make the van even more spacious we installed a swivel chair mechanism to the passenger seat.
This addition is worth all the money (~100EU on Ebay) as it creates a comfy place for computer activities.

For the sake of privacy and stealthy look, we separated the front cabin of the van
from the living part with dark curtains attached to the very silent drape runners.

## Insulation and Ventilation

The van came insulated by the previous owner. Unfortunately, the insulation is just OK as
it does not cover all surface and the used materials are not well suited for the task.
So, due to lack of better thermo resistance it becomes hot when it is hot outside, and it gets quite
cold when outside it's subzero. If we have had more time, we would have remade it.

Fortunately, the van has a heater inside (Webasto AirTop 2000) running on diesel.
The very small amount of fuel heats up the whole living space pretty quickly.

For air circulation we have a roof vent. It prevents from condensation, gives some fresh air,
and allows us to cook inside without opening the side door. Nice
thing about the vent is that when it rains you can leave it open, as it does not let
a water to poor in.

## Kitchen

No more eating out!

The van comes with a 2-burner gas stove which enables us to cook inside. The gas is stored
in 12.5l gas bottle containing 5kg of propane butane mix which is enough for ~2.5 months.

Once in France we ran out of gas, and it was difficult to find a bottle which would fit
our gas regulator.
So, we had to buy an overpriced Campergaz setup. Half of the cost would have been saved if we had
bought Gaslow Camping Gas adaptor before which allows you to connect a Campergaz 907
bottle to common gas regulators. However, a good thing about this setup, that in most European
countries you can easily refill the Campergaz bottle.

Next to the stove we have a water sink with a tap. Water comes from 25l
water tank and a waste goes to another water container. Water is supplied
with a very common Reich EASY 14 water pump (14l/min) placed in the water tank.

Fun fact that 25l of water is enough for roughly two days.

A modern kitchen contains a fridge, but we decided not to have one due to high power requirements.
We are not heavy meat eaters, so most of our food can stay in the shelves. Also,
we are doing grocery shopping every third day.

## Electricity and Lightning

This was the most interesting part. From the very beginning it was clear that
a solar panel is a must. The only question was what kind and how big. After doing
a lot of research online and some calculations we ended up buying the following:

- 200W monochrome solar panel with a smart circuit which works in partial
  shade
- EPEVER 20A MPPT solar charge controller
- 2x Exide EP800 AGM 95 Ah batteries

The biggest pain with the solar was that due to the odd location of the roof vent,
only a non-standard sized panel could fit on the roof. Luckily, one UK-based
company had such panel.

In the case of sun being absent a few days in a row we installed a split
charger.

So far the solar thing has been working very well. Despite decent power usage (mostly
laptops and lights) we have never used the split charger as the batteries never
discharge below 50%. Probably related - we are spending winter in Spain.

To charge laptops we got 12V DC/DC chargers which should be more efficient
than using DC/AC converter and then a regular AC/DC charger.

Instead of getting way too overpriced 12V LED light panels for campervans, we
bought some cheap LED light panels for 220V powered houses, rip them apart,
and put a 12V LED stripes - works well.

## Misc

There are more small things which deserve mentioning.

First of all, we got a shower which is a 20l black plastic bag. If it's sunny,
we place the bag on the front panel of the van, and water inside becomes relatively warm.
If it's cold, we boil a bit of water. Showering happens outside.
Anyway, you definitely don't need to shower every day.

Second, we don't have a toilet inside, as we live most of the time in nature.
Instead, we got a shovel.

Third, we do laundry approximately once per month, and we use public laundry
services.

Finally - no internet. This deserves a separate blog post. Living without internet was a blast to the mighty '90s.

_So, in the end, was it worth? Oh YES!_
