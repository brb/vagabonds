After enjoying tough Easter European climbing in Osp, we went back home for a
couple of weeks to discharge the batteries. On the way back, we got an instant dose
of not so repetitive techno by [Paula Temple](https://soundcloud.com/paulatemple/deathvox-deathvox-ep) and [Ancient Methods](https://soundcloud.com/platform/ancient-methods-1) in Berlin.
Sleeping in the van at Kreuzberg was a new experience for both of us.

Home time was great - family, friends and ... fast internet. However, to avoid
a real danger of getting used to the sneaky comfort, we set a deadline for the end of the stay.

By the end of November, we were back in the van and heading south to
Catalunya to hibernate for the winter.

The journey from Lithuania to Catalunya (~3000km) took us so long that the van
seat almost became an integral part of my body. To ease the pain, we made a
quick detour to visit Aistė and Povilas, our friends who are still stuck in Stuttgart.

During the insane ride it was raining heavily. "Why is our bed wet?" asks me
Laura. Damn! The roof is leaking. Not so nice for the start, but fortunately it is
_kinderleicht_ to find materials for repair in a country which is fond of engineering.

# Siurana

First climbing stop was in Siurana which always associated with sunny, long,
vertical and technical routes. However, this time they were not so sunny. It was subzero
during nights and sometimes so cold during the day that even a few warmup routes
in a row did not warm us. Luckily, they were still vertical and technical which I find
more and more fun.

Unfortunately, Laura managed to partly rupture the A2 pulley of her middle finger. Trying
to climb the very crimpy "La Crema" (7c+) to check whether her finger is doing
right ended up with a visit to a hand doctor who suggested a surgery. After reading a
handful of resources on such injuries ([this](https://medium.com/@jamesleedpt/a2-pulley-injuries-in-rock-climbing-9cb00fa6f3bf), [this](https://www.tensionclimbing.com/tension-climbing-blog/2017/2/12/pulley-injury-review), [this](https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/108312799/a2-pulley-surgery) and [this](https://www.ukclimbing.com/forums/walls+training/a2_pulley_rupture_surgery_or_conservative_approach-621236)) she decided to take a
conservative approach - rest and start slowly climbing to increase the blood flow
in her fingers to foster the healing process. Anyway, at the time of writing
her finger is getting better and she can cruise 7b's. Strong and tough as always.

Meanwhile, I was enjoying tons of technical 7a/+'s and a lot of attention from my
less-climbing belayer.

# Margalef

Getting bored after staying at the same place for two weeks becomes a new
norm (we both suffer from ADHD). So, an escape was made to Margalef.

Margalef is an antonym to Siurana - short, steep, bouldery and full of
pockets. A common thing these two crags shared was a bloody coldness.
No sun meant no climbing, and in total we only climbed one day there. Bummer.

# XXX

While being in Margalef, we got a message from our friends Anna and Tadas that they were
going to climb with Tomas somewhere not that far away from Margalef next day.
Tomukas and Tadukas - [two legends](http://onsight.lt/keliones/2003/cekija.html) of Lithuanian climbing.
Even such climbing dinosaur as Laura started climbing way later than they had
their first adventures on rocks. So, the decision was obvious.

Climbing took place at a secret spot bolted a month ago. I have never climbed
on such a virgin rock. Breaking holds, no footmarks or chalked holds contributed to
the awesome outing, and we all got to experience the real onsight climbing.

The end of the day was not less memorable - watching stars literally in the
middle of nowhere through telescope made by Tadas. Sadly, moon was new,
so Tadas couldn't show it.

# Chulilla

Next stop was Chulilla. We both are loyal to traditions, so not only
we spent New Year Eve there, but also got sick. [Totally the same as last year](http://www.vagabonds.lt/2017/01/22/chulilla.html).

This year there was even a bigger crowd - Mykolas and Gabrielė, Anna and Tadas, Vida
and Jacint, Povilas and Aistė. Vida and Jacint even joined the campervans family
with their white VW - a must if you live and climb in Catalunya.

My recovery from sickness took part on tufas at the Chorreras sector. Long pumpy routes
and Vida shouting "venga!" made me sweat a lot, so next day I was healthy again to try
something harder.

After Povilas, Laura and me flashed 40m long "Maricon El Ultimo" 7b, three of us jumped to project
"Nibelungalo" 7c - 35m long polished and slightly overhanging fight against lactic acid in muscles.
Finally, probably due to the motivated partners, I became less hesitant to try 7c.
Fun fact was that everyday we met someone else climbing the route, and their belayers
were climbers whom you can see on TV.

Povilas, as usually, was impressing us with his no bullshit approach to
climbing - 100% concentration, no lame excuses and "just do it".
After maybe 4 hard tries on the project, he asked us to show easier good climbs
while we were thinking about calling it a day. We pointed to "Camino de Leche" - 40m long 7a+
with the crux at the very top. 30min later and Povilas is at the crux, [bing
bing bong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKbOqEk6rsk) and he is already in the air. At the bottom he asked about
giving another go while it was getting dark. Damn, such motivation (and
determination)!

The last day conditions were perfect for the route - low temps and strong
winds. I could literally feel how my shoes' rubber sticks to the rock.
Just after Laura clipped the chain (on her 4th go), owners of the quickdraws
placed on the project showed up and without any hesitation skipped the waiting
queue. Such maneuver quite pissed me off as according to my climbing ethics nobody can
"reserve" a route for themselves. Just wait in line as others do, or don't go
climbing on a busy day. Unfortunately, it was too late after they finished, so no
send this time for me and my buddy.

# Gandia

We had another arrangement made to climb with friends. This time in El Chorro
which is reachable from Chulilla via Costa Blanca - yet another climbing paradise
in Spain. We had a few days to explore this region.

We picked Gandia - very easily approachable wall surrounded by trees full of
oranges ready to pick. Some parts of the wall very steep, and we enjoyed pumping
the iron on it. Both of us managed to clip the chain of the sustained "Enya" 7b.

Next, some multi pitching...

# Peñon d'Ifach

Peñon d'Ifach is a big wall located near a very touristic city of Calpe
belonging to Costa Blanca.
The iconic wall was on my list since I had seen [this trip report](https://big-walls.blogspot.com.es/2009/11/winter-sun-costa-blanca.html).

The route we chose was on the south face of the wall and it
was called "Mare Nostrum" (7a+, 240m, 9pt) - well equipped and well exposed.

The day was full of cruxes, none was actually a climbing crux: finding a
toilet in the morning, hanging belays, avoiding flying bird poos.

The first block was led by Laura, the second by me. While following the second
pitch (6c+) I got very pumped and concerned about my block and its very last crux pitch -
overhanging 7a. Luckily, I managed to shake my hands off, and all the multi
pitch went free.
