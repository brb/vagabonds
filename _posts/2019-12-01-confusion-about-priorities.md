The end of the vanlife stage was marked by mishaps. One of them was that while
climbing I permanently damaged my middle finger joint cartilage, which put
a big question mark over my future climbing.

Instead of falling deep into depression, my best therapist, aka my wife,
suggested to explore other sports which previously were shadowed by the king
of all sports.

That's how skiing came to light.

In the past we skied a bit, but just a bit. We even did a skitour. The season
began with a poor technique and very ungraceful movements. Luckily, some
buddies patiently waited for us even on a powder day.

All weekends and some weekdays before work of 2018/2019 winter and spring
unintentionally got allocated for skiing. Checking snow reports
(big up to wepowder.com), deciding where to drive (being based next to Northern Alps
has some advantages) became part of a daily routine. Our minds got obsessed
with where to get the best powder.
